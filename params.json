{"name":"CyLP","tagline":"A Python interface to CLP, CBC, and CGL to solve LPs and MIPs.","body":"Installation\r\n============\r\n\r\nSTEP 1:\r\n    Install CoinMP. You can get the source at\r\n    http://www.coin-or.org/download/source/CoinMP/. CyLP can be compiled against\r\n    CoinMP-1.6.0. To compile CyLP you will need a LAPACK\r\n    implementation and BZIP2 installed. If you are on a MAC or a linux\r\n    system you might already have both.\r\n    To compile CoinMP's source you may need to pass 'g95' to configure::\r\n\r\n        $ ./configure F77=/path/to/g95\r\n        $ make\r\n        $ make install\r\n\r\nSTEP 2:\r\n    Create an environment variable called COIN_INSTALL_DIR pointing to your\r\n    installation of Coin. For example::\r\n\r\n        $ export COIN_INSTALL_DIR=/Users/mehdi/CoinMP-1.6.0\r\n\r\n    You may also add this line to your ~/.bash_rc or ~/.profile to make\r\n    it persistent.\r\n\r\nSTEP 3:\r\n    Install CyLP. Go to CyLP's root directory and run::\r\n\r\n        $ python setup.py install\r\n\r\nSTEP 4 (LINUX):\r\n     In linux you might also need to add COIN's lib directory to\r\n     LD_LIBRARY_PATH as follows::\r\n\r\n        $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/CoinMP-1.6.0/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\"\r\n\r\nOptional step:\r\n    If you want to run the doctests (i.e. ``make doctest`` in the ``doc`` directory)\r\n    you should also define::\r\n\r\n        $ export CYLP_SOURCE_DIR=/Path/to/CyLP\r\n\r\nNow you can use CyLP in your python code. For example:\r\n\r\n    >>> from CyLP.cy import CyClpSimplex\r\n    >>> s = CyClpSimplex()\r\n    >>> s.readMps('../input/netlib/adlittle.mps')\r\n    0\r\n    >>> s.initialSolve()\r\n    'optimal'\r\n    >>> round(s.objectiveValue, 3)\r\n    225494.963\r\n\r\nOr simply go to CyLP and run::\r\n\r\n    $ python -m unittest discover\r\n\r\nto run all CyLP unit tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n=======\r\n\r\nTo run the primal Simplex method on a problem in MPS format, use::\r\n\r\n    $ python CyLP/py/PySolve.py input/netlib/25fv47.mps d\r\n\r\nor::\r\n\r\n    $ python CyLP/cy/CySolve.py input/netlib/25fv47.mps d\r\n\r\nUse `p` instead of the trailing `d` to use the positive edge pivot rule instead of Dantzig's canonical pivot rule.\r\n\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n===============\r\nYou may access CyLP's documentation:\r\n\r\n    1. *Online* : http://mpy.github.com/CyLP.\r\n\r\n    2. *Offline* : To install CyLP's documentation in your repository, you need Sphinx (http://sphinx.pocoo.org/). You can generate the documentation by going to CyLP/doc and run ``make html`` or ``make latex`` and access the documentation under CyLP/doc/build. You can also run ``make doctest`` to perform all the doctest.\r\n","google":"UA-43999736-1","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
