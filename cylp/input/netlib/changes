  1 June 1987:   mpc.src added.
  6 May 1988:    GREENBEA, GREENBEB, AGG, AGG2, AGG3 added.
  25 June 1988:  STOCFOR1,2 added
  16 Jan. 1989:  STOCFOR3 added; bound and range information added to
index file; MINOS 5.3 optimal values inserted.
  23 Jan. 1989:  correction to bound-handling portion of STOCFOR3 source
code.  This does not affect STOCFOR3 itself, but is relevant to other
uses of this Fortran code.
  6 April 1989: BLEND BOEING1 BOEING2 FINNIS PEROLD SC105 SC50A SC50B
added.
  27 June 1989: CYCLE KB2 LOTFI TUFF WOOD1P WOODW added.
  30 Oct. 1989: BNL1 BNL2 D2Q06C DEGEN2 DEGEN3 added.
  30 Nov. 1989: options -s and -S added to emps.c so you can request
several problems at once and split them into files named by the
problem name (in upper case with -S or in lower case with -s).  For
use with these new options, the NAME line of several problems has now
been modified so that the first word after "NAME" gives the name
specified above for the problem.  Now all compressed MPS files have
this property.  The problems whose NAME line was thus modified are
BLEND, BOEING1, FINNIS, FORPLAN, PEROLD, PILOT, PILOTNOV, STANDGUB,
STANDMPS, STOCFOR1, and STOCFOR2.
  22 Jan. 1990: all material described here made available by
anonymous ftp from research.att.com .
  31 Jan. 1990: FIT1D, FIT1P, FIT2D, FIT2P added.
  8 Feb. 1990: emps.c, emps.f modified to quietly ignore extra lines at
the end of a compressed MPS file (e.g., those that mailers add).
  15 Feb. 1990: added table of optimal values reported by Bob Bixby.
  26 Feb. 1990: TRUSS added.
  30 Apr. 1990: ascii (table of ASCII codes) added; MINOS(MIPS)
optimal values added to this index file.
  15 June 1990: MAROS and PILOT87 added.
  11 Oct. 1990: DFL001 added.
  9 Jan. 1991: Bixby's remarks about DFL001 added to index.
  6 June 1991: emps.c and emps.f adjusted to pass "mystery lines"
through, for possible use in conveying other problem information
(in connection with mpc -m).  [For years emps.c has had this ability;
today's change fixes a bug with mystery lines just before ENDATA.]
  4 Sept. 1991: "Kennington" problems made available by ftp from netlib.
  21 Oct. 1991: minor cleanups...
1. BOEING1: remove duplicate upper bounds for columns N1019AC3 and
N1019AC4.
2. PILOT: remove 8 duplicate right-hand side values for row BTRB01.
3. PILOT87: remove lower bound of 49.5 on U[OG]ST0[12], which are
subsequently fixed at 99 (UOST[12]) or 65.4.
  2 May 1992: emps.c ANSIfied (with #ifdef KR_headers lines for
old-style C compilers); new option -b changes blanks within names
to underscores (and changes blank RHS names to RHS, etc.) -- for
awk scripts and other programs that assume no blanks in names.
  4 Feb. 1993: stocfor3 updated.  STOCFOR3 and the other problems
you can generate with the data in the stocfor3 bundle are the same
numerically as before (but with different row and column labels).
The update (courtesy of Gus Gassmann) fixes some bugs in other uses
of the generator and expands your options in using the generator.
The previous version is now stocfor3.old.
  26 March 1993: D6CUBE added.
  17 Jan. 1994: MAROS-R7, MODSZK1 added.
  12 April 1996: QAP8, QAP12, QAP15 added to result table; directory
lp/generators/qap added for generating these problems.
  7 August 2005:  objective value for STOCFOR3 in CPLEX(Sparc) column
of readme adjusted; some file names in "read.me" in the stocfor3
bundle corrected; portability tweaks to mpc.src.
  25 Feb. 2008: emps.c, mpc.src: tweak to compile with fewer complaints.
